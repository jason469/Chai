          Chai is a soft toy tracking application, used to create back stories and document the lives of your various
          soft toys.
          You can name them, assign them hobbies, job, partners, even schedules that they carry out every day.

          It might seem a little silly haha, but its a cute way to interact with your soft toys, affectionately
          called cwimpies!

        On a technical level, Chai was built as a PWA, using Angular in the frontend, NodeJS and Express as the backend,
        and MongoDB as a database. I also deployed it using Firebase.
